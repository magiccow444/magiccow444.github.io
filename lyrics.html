            Who's to say what's impossible
            Well, they forgot this world keeps spinning
            And with each new day
            I can feel a change in everything
            And as the surface breaks, reflections fade
            But in some ways, they remain the same
            And as my mind begins to spread its wings
            There's no stopping curiosity
            
            I want to turn the whole thing upside down
            I'll find the things they say just can't be found
            I'll share this love I find with everyone
            We'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's songs
            I don't want this feeling to go away
            
            Who's to say I can't do everything
            Well, I can try
            And as I roll along, I begin to find
            Things aren't always just what they seem
            
            I want to turn the whole thing upside down
            I'll find the things they say just can't be found
            I'll share this love I find with everyone
            We'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's songs
            This world keeps spinning and there's no time to waste
            Well, it all keeps spinning, spinning 'round and 'round and
            
            Upside down
            Who's to say what's impossible and can't be found?
            I don't want this feeling to go away
            
            Please don't go away
            Please don't go away
            Please don't go away
            
            Is this how it's supposed to be?
